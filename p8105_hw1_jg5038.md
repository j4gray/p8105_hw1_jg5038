```

## Problem 1

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

The variables in this dataset are origin, year, month, day, hour, temp,
dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib,
time_hour.

In the year column we can see that the data covers 2013 during the 1st
month of the year for 15.

The size of the dataset is 358 rows x 15 columns

The mean temperature is 39.5821229

Here is a scatterplot of temp (y) vs time_hour (x):

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x=temp, y=time_hour, color=humid)) + geom_point()
```

From the plot we can see that there is a cycle of temperature during the
day with higher temperatures observed around midday and humidity going
up with temperature. We can also see that the temperature rises as the
month progresses with temperatures at the end of the month higher than
at the beginning.

``` r
ggsave("early_january_weather_plot.png")
```
